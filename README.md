# jukebox
This is a very basic basic basic jukebox. Did I say it was basic?
This is also part of all the course on lynda.com with Ray Villalobos for learning JavaScript. This was to deal with a basic 
jukebox and making sure that you could change song whenever you wanted.

I did have a big haha moment in this project when I truly learned the difference between JS and jQuery when selecting an element.

In JS you select a DOM element but in jQuery you actualy work with a jQuery object not directly the DOM element.
By the way if you want the Dom element with jQuery you have to do this: $('selector').get(0);
There I just saved you an afternoon of headaches!

Has always if you have any comments on the code or know a way to make it better cleaner of to better fallow best practices don't hesitate
share your thoughts.

your welcome ;)
